Listen, Angela. I’ve heard great news about your sister. They say that she got married last month.
 Is it true?
Yes, it is. Mary and Bob celebrated their wedding 2 weeks ago. It was such a wonderful day.
I still can’t believe that your sister has become a wife. Where did they meet each other?
They met in Spain, at the seaside, during their holidays. They both had so much in common, 
so they fell in love with each other immediately, at first sight.
I see. And relaxing on the beach, going on dates, walking in the moonlight, eating out in
 exotic restaurants near the sea… everything was so romantic, I guess.
Oh yes. Mary realized that Bob was the man whom she had searched for the whole life, so 
she couldn’t imagine her life without him anymore. But she was still afraid that it was just a holiday fling for Bob.
So how did they communicate when they parted and returned home?
Every day my sister woke up and fell asleep with a smile on her face because Bob kept o
n calling and writing endless letters all days long. He told her about his love and serious intentions.
